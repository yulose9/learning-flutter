# Flutter & Dart - The Complete Guide Course Resources

This repository contains various course resources (code snapshots, slides etc.) for our [Flutter & Dart - The Complete Guide course](https://acad.link/flutter).

## How To Use

This repository contains three main folder:

- [Code Snapshots](/Code%20Snapshots/): Contains code snapshots for the examples used in the course lectures (also see [Using the Code Snapshots](#using-the-code-snapshots))
- [Lecture Attachments](/Lecture%20Attachments/): Contains files that are needed in individual lectures (course videos typically refer to those attachments)
- [Slides](/Slides/): Contains the course slides

## Using the Code Snapshots

The [Code Snapshots](/Code%20Snapshots/) exist to help you debug your code. You can use them to compare your code to the code written in the course in case you get stuck.

If you can't find the error that's causing your app to crash or look differently, use the snapshot files to, step-by-step, replace your code with the one provided here. This should allow you to narrow down the issue and fix your code.

The code snapshot folders contain the `lib/` folder, any additional assets that might be needed and the `pubspec.yaml` file (which can be used to identify which third-party packages must be installed).

Please note that the code snapshots are **not standalone projects** that may be executed! They only exist to help you **compare your code**!

## Finding the Right Code Snapshot

Inside the [Code Snapshots](/Code%20Snapshots/) folder, you find subfolders for the different course sections. For example, [Code Snapshots/02 Flutter & Dart Basics I](/Code%20Snapshots/02%20Flutter%20%26%20Dart%20Basics%20I/) refers to the second course section.

Inside the course section folders, you typically find multiple snapshots per section. These different snapshots reflect different stages of the demo project throughout the section. The individual snapshot folder names were chosen according to the lectures they belong to.
